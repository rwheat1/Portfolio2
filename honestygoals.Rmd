```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

```{r dataframe}
goalratings <- read_sav("TransposedGoals.sav")
```


## Scatterplot of Goal Ratings

```{r scatterplot}
#avg. rating for dishonesty x avg. rating for honesty

ggplot(data = goalratings,
       mapping = aes(x = Avg_DisLikelihood, y = Avg_HonLikelihood)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Likelihood that dishonesty would acheive goal", y = "Likelihood that honesty would acheive goal")
```

## Filtering Goals That Pull In Both Directions


```{r filtering}
goalratings %>%
  arrange(desc(Diff_Likelihood))

goalratings <- goalratings %>%
  filter(Diff_Likelihood <= 2.14) %>%
  filter(Diff_Likelihood >= -1.43) %>%
  arrange(desc(Diff_Likelihood))

ggplot(data = goalratings,
       mapping = aes(x = Avg_DisLikelihood, y = Avg_HonLikelihood)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Likelihood that dishonesty would acheive goal", y = "Likelihood that honesty would acheive goal")



```


```{r}
skimr::skim(TransposedGoals)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
